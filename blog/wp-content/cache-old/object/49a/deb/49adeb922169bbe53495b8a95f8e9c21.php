";}s:25:"penci_recipe_instructions";a:1:{i:0;s:1055:"Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil.
Remove the tops of the broccoli and slice in four. Shave the tips of some of them to obtain 20 g of small grains (couscous) to use as a garnish.
Peel and dice the base of the broccoli and cook (except the couscous) for 8 to 10 minutes. Chill in ice water to fix the chlorophyll and keep it green. Set aside 300 ml of cooking water.

Remove the mushroom caps and dice the bases. Finely chop the red onion and sweat the mushrooms and onion in a frying pan with a drizzle of olive oil (set aside some of the diced mushroom). Season with lime zests and juice (do not add salt as the cooking water is already salted).

Blend all of the cooked ingredients with a hand blender, adding basil and the remainder of the olive oil. The soup should be smooth and creamy.

Pour into your MB Lib and top with the broccoli couscous, diced raw mushrooms and a few pink peppercorns.

For an even tastier treat, add a few crumbled fried onions.

This healthy and delicious recipe is suitable for low-fat diets.
