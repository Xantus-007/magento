				<td><b>Do I win every time one my friends wins ?</b></td>

			<tr>
				<td>
					No, you only win if your friend played after clicking on the link you sent him. If he plays by himself, you won’t win, even if he wins.<br/><br/>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><b>I already invited a friend on a previous prize and I invite him again: does it works if he wins ?</b></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					Yes, you should invite your friends each time there’s a new prize. If they win, you win too. But there’s only two friends winning each time.<br/><br/>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><b>Why don’t I see all of my friends when I want to invite them ?</b></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					There’s two possibilities, you may already invite friends on that prize (another friend invited them), or they already played by themselves on that prize.<br/><br/>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><b>I’m B, sponsored by A, I sponsor C and C wins, who else wins ?</b></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					You, B, will also win because your friend won. But A doesn’t win because you didn’t directly won that prize. When a prize is won, it can be won only by two people at the same time (The winners and its sponsor, If he has one!)
